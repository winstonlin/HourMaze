HourMaze
========

This is a C++ Application that can be used to solve an Hour Maze. It was made using the Allegro library. This was coded back in 2010, a couple of years ago, but I decided to add it to GitHub as I had been asked a couple of times for the source.

An example as to how to use the application can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/knukqfu
